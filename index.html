<h1> DSNY facilities located in areas with high flood risk</h1>
<h3> New York's Department of Sanitation operates 14 disposal facilities in the five boroughs. Five of them are located in possible flood zones.</h3>

	<p> A quarter of DSNY management or transfer facilities are located in areas with a high flood vulnerability rating. Flooding at these facilities could result in trash flowing into the streets or being swept out to sea.</p>

	<p> The affected facilities include two stations in Brooklyn and one each in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. SouthWest Marine Transfer Station just north of Coney Island and 91st Street Transfer Station on the Upper East Side had the worst scores.  </p>

	<p> "This is a situation that could lead to potentially dangerous conditions," said James Booth, a professor of atmospheric science at the City College of New York. "Flood waters could lead to the unintended spread of toxic pollutants." </p>

	<p> The Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI) is calculated by the Mayor's Office of Climate and Environmental Justice, and measures flood vulnerability using three criteria: exposure to a hazard, susceptability to harm from the exposure and capacity to recover. An FVI is calculated for six different hazard scenarios, including storm surges and tidal flooding. </p>
